"""Sentiment analyst: one sentiment report from three sources.

The node fetches its sources before calling the model and puts them in the
prompt, so the model reports on data it was given rather than inventing posts:

  1. News headlines: Yahoo Finance
  2. StockTwits messages: the cashtag stream, with Bullish/Bearish tags
  3. Reddit posts: r/wallstreetbets, r/stocks, r/investing, or crypto communities for a crypto pair

Each source is trimmed to the analysis window. With a TypeSafe key, the social
posts are screened by Jev first (see post_screen). These feeds serve recent items
and are not archived, so a historical run's sentiment inputs are not
point-in-time.

The report is a SentimentReport through structured output where the provider
supports it and free text otherwise, so the band, score and confidence header
reads the same across providers.

## Data sources (pre-fetched, in this prompt)

### News headlines — Yahoo Finance, past 7 days
Institutional framing. Fact-driven, slower-moving signal.

<start_of_news>
{news_block}
<end_of_news>

### StockTwits messages — retail-trader social platform indexed by cashtag
Fast-moving signal. Each message carries a user-labeled sentiment tag (Bullish / Bearish / no-label) plus the message body.

<start_of_stocktwits>
{stocktwits_block}
<end_of_stocktwits>

### Reddit posts — {", ".join(f"r/{sub}" for sub in subreddits)} (past 7 days)
Community discussion, without vote or comment counts. Subreddit character matters ({character}).

<start_of_reddit>
{reddit_block}
<end_of_reddit>
{_extra_source_blocks(extra_blocks)}
## How to analyze this data (best practices)

1. **Read the StockTwits Bullish/Bearish ratio as a leading retail-sentiment signal.** A 70/30 bullish/bearish split is moderately bullish; ≥90/10 may indicate over-extension and contrarian risk; 50/50 is uncertainty. Sample size matters — base rates on the actual message count, not percentages alone. A block headed "Screened by Jev" has had off-topic posts removed; its stance count is a classifier's read of every on-topic post fetched, labelled or not, of which the posts listed are a sample. Read it alongside the user tags.

2. **Look for cross-source divergences.** If news framing is bearish but StockTwits is overwhelmingly bullish, that mismatch is itself a signal — it can mean retail is leaning into a thesis the news flow hasn't caught up to (or vice versa, that retail is chasing while institutions are cautious).

3. **Read Reddit posts for substance.** The feed carries no vote or comment counts, so judge a post by its body excerpt, not its title alone, and do not infer engagement.

4. **Distinguish opinion from event.** A news headline ("Nvidia announces $500M Corning deal") is an event; a StockTwits post ("buying NVDA, this is going to moon") is opinion. Both are inputs but should be weighted differently in your conclusions.

5. **Identify recurring narrative themes.** What topic keeps coming up across sources? That's the dominant narrative driving current sentiment.

6. **Be honest about data limits.** If StockTwits returned only a handful of messages, or one or more sources returned an "<unavailable>" placeholder, the sentiment read is less robust — flag this explicitly in the `confidence` field and the narrative. If the sources are silent on a given subreddit, say so.

7. **Identify catalysts and risks** that emerge across sources — news of upcoming earnings, product launches, competitive threats, macro headlines, etc.

8. **Past sentiment is not predictive.** Frame your conclusions as signal for the trader to weigh alongside fundamentals and technicals, not as a price call.

## Output fields

Fill the following fields:

- **overall_band**: Exactly one of Bullish / Mildly Bullish / Neutral / Mixed / Mildly Bearish / Bearish. Use Mixed when sources point in clearly different directions; Neutral only when all sources are genuinely silent.
- **overall_score**: A number from 0 (maximally bearish) to 10 (maximally bullish); 5 is neutral. Keep it consistent with overall_band.
- **confidence**: low / medium / high, based on data quality and sample size.
- **narrative**: Full source-by-source breakdown, divergences, dominant narrative themes, catalysts and risks, and a markdown summary table of key sentiment signals (direction, source, supporting evidence).
